We are pleased to announce that we open a sponsor program for pepy.tech. With the sponsor program we plan to give sponsors visibility to their projects and also finance pepy.tech to  improve the product.

# December stats

If you want to become a sponsor here are some stats that you may find useful, if you need more simply ask me at petru@pepy.tech:

* 10k python developers (Google Analytics)
* 28k page views (Google Analytics)
* 5M requests in December (Cloudflare)
* 273k unique IPS (Cloudflare)
* 41 GB of data served (Cloudflare)
* 350 stars on GitHub

# Benefits

Some benefits of becoming a sponsor are:

👀 Show your logo on the website and the GitHub README.

🔝 The feature requests get higher priority.

❤️ Contribute to maintain the website alive.

☕️ Get me some coffee in the mornings to develop features faster.

# Price

€150 per month.

We will have at most 3 sponsors at any time.

# How do I become a sponsor?

Simply send me a message at petru@pepy.tech, and we will be in touch. The payment will be handled by our [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/pepy) account.

# On what we will spend the money?

* Improving our infrastructure: currently a single server is serving all the requests around the world. Surely we can improve our response time, service availability and reduce maintenance cost by paying more.

* Motivate me: pretty sure I will get extra motivation ok keeping adding new features and maintaining the website alive.
